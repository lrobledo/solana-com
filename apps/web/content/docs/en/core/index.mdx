To build on Solana, it's essential to understand the key concepts unique to
Solana development. This section covers the core concepts you need to understand
as you start building on Solana, including accounts, transactions, programs, and
more.

## Solana Accounts

All data on the Solana blockchain is stored as an [Account](/docs/references/terminology#account).
The structure resembles a key-value store,
in which the key is the on-chain address and the value is an Account.

Learn more about [Accounts](/docs/core/accounts).

## Transactions and Instructions

On Solana, transactions are used to interact with the network.
Each transaction may include one or more instructions.
Each instruction represents a specific operation to be processed.
The execution logic for instructions is stored on programs deployed to the Solana network.

Learn more about [Transactions](/docs/core/transactions) and
[Instructions](/docs/core/transactions#instruction).

## Fees

There are a few different types of fees
that can be incurred when using the Solana blockchain.
These can be grouped into a few specific types:

- **Transaction Fees**: A fee to have validators process transactions & instructions
- **Prioritization Fees**: An optional fee to boost a transaction's processing order
- **Rent**: A withheld balance to keep data stored on-chain

Learn more about [Fees on Solana](/docs/core/fees).

## Programs on Solana

On Solana, smart contracts are called programs. Each program is stored in an
on-chain account and contains executable code with specific instructions.
These instructions represent the program's functionality and are invoked
by sending transactions to the network.

Learn more about [Programs on Solana](/docs/core/programs).

## Program Derived Address

Program-derived addresses (PDAs) provide developers with two main use cases:

- **Deterministic Account Addresses**: In which a combination of predefined inputs (seeds)
  and a specific program ID are used to deterministically derive an address.
- **Program Signing**: The Solana runtime enables programs to "sign" for
  PDAs which are derived from its program ID.

[//]: # (Sign for PDAs with PDAs??)

You can think of PDAs as a way to create hashmap-like structures on-chain using a
predefined set of inputs (e.g. strings, numbers, and other account addresses).

Learn more about [Program Derived Address](/docs/core/pda).

## Cross-program Invocation

Cross-program invocation (CPI) occurs when one program invokes the instructions of another,
allowing for the composability of Solana programs.
To conceptualize the concept,
imagine a program's set of instructions as a set of API endpoints.
A CPI occurs when one endpoint invokes another.)

Learn more about [Cross Program Invocation](/docs/core/cpi).

## Tokens on Solana

Tokens are digital assets that represent ownership over diverse categories of assets.
Tokenization enables the digitalization of property rightsâ€”a
fundamental component for managing fungible and non-fungible assets.

- **Fungible Tokens**: Interchangeable and divisible assets of the same
  type and value (ex. USDC).
- **Non-fungible Tokens (NFT):** Ownership of indivisible assets (e.g. artwork).

## Clusters and Endpoints

The Solana blockchain has several different groups of validators, known as
[clusters](/docs/references/clusters). Each clusters serves a different purpose and
contains dedicated nodes to fulfill [JSON-RPC](/docs/rpc/) requests.
There are three primary clusters on the Solana network, shown in the table below:

| Name    | Endpoint                               | Use                       |
|---------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Mainnet | `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`  | Production                |
| Devnet  | `https://api.devnet.solana.com`        | Developer experimentation |
| Testnet | `https://api.testnet.solana.com`       | Validator testing         |
