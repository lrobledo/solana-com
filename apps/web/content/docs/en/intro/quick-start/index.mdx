Welcome to the Solana quick start guide!
This hands-on guide will introduce you to the **Solana Playground** (Solpg),
where you can learn core-concepts, regardless of your prior experience.
In this tutorial, you will learn about:

- **Solana Accounts**: How the Solana network stores data
- **Sending Transactions**: How to interact with the Solana network by sending
  transactions
- **Building and Deploying Programs**: Create your first Solana program and
  deploy it to the network
- **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**: Learn how to use PDAs to create
  deterministic addresses for accounts
- **Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs)**: Learn how to call other programs from
  within your program, enabling complex interactions and composability between
  different programs on Solana

##  The Solana Playground

The Solana Playground is a browser-based development environment that
allows you to develop, deploy, and test Solana programs without installing anything locally.
Follow along, copy, and paste code, and see results immediately.
Basic programming knowledge helps, but is not required.
Time to dive in and start building with Solana!

As a new user, the first step to interacting with the Solana Playground
is to create a Playground Wallet and add SOL.
This wallet will allow you to interact with the Solana network directly from your browser.

## Create a Playground Wallet

<Steps>
<Step>

### Navigate to the Solana Playground

Using your web browser, navigate to the [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/).

</Step>
<Step>

### Connect to the Playground

Click the ðŸ”´ **Not connected** text at the bottom left corner of the screen.

</Step>
<Step>

### Save your Keypair

Click **Save keypair** to save your key pair locally.
When you're ready, click **Continue**.

[//]: # (What can I do with this info once I save it?)
[//]: # (ex. will additional info help me decide where I want to save this?)

![Create Playground Wallet](/assets/docs/intro/quickstart/pg-create-wallet.png)

At the bottom of the screen, you will see that you are now connected to the Playground Wallet.
You will also see the [connected cluster](/docs/references/terminology#connected-cluster) (`devnet`),
the [wallet address](/docs/references/terminology#wallet-address), and your [SOL](/docs/references/terminology#sol) balance.

<Callout>
  Your browser's local storage saves your Playground Wallet. Clearing your
  browser cache removes your saved wallet.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
Use your Playground Wallet only for testing and development.
Never send real assets (from [`mainnet`](/docs/references/terminology#connected-cluster)) to this address.
</Callout>

Congratulations!
You created your first Solana Wallet.
You are now ready to add SOL to your wallet.

</Step>

<Step>

### Add SOL to Your Wallet

Before starting development, you need to add devnet SOL to your wallet.
As a developer, you need SOL for two main use cases:

- To create new accounts for storing data or deploying programs
- Paying transaction fees when interacting with the Solana network

You can add devnet SOL to your wallet using the Playground terminal
or with the Devnet Faucet.
Each option is described below:

#### Option 1: Use the Playground Terminal

Run the following command in the Playground terminal:

```terminal
$ solana airdrop 5
```

#### Option 2: Use the Devnet Faucet

If option 1 fails, due to rate limits or other errors, use
Solana's [Web Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/).

- Enter your wallet address
- Select an amount
- Click **Confirm Airdrop**

[//]: # (I tried doing this after the first command worked, will try again after spending some of the SOL)
[//]: # (Actually, I see that I now have 10 SOL, but it had looked like it hadn't worked. just a note)

</Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that you have created a Payground wallet and added Devnet SOL, you are ready to
